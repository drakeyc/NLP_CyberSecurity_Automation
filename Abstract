With the growing expansion of connectivity in vehicles, this produces a greater risk of vulnerabil- ities and exploitations inside and outside the vehi- cle. Different exploits can include, but are not lim- ited to, signal hacking, SQL injection, Bluetooth low energy (BLE) hacking, mobile-app hacking, API hacking, and many more. As the risk grows exponentially with the expansion of connectiv- ity, possible solutions include secure by design methodology, network monitoring (for the ”loud” and ”noisy” hackers), and other methods. As engineers write, test, and verify cyber security requirements of different aspects of the vehicle, they may run into large data sets that are unfa- miliar to the human eye. This may be because they are verifying encrypted data, or have to ver- ify “unusual” data sets. With the utilization of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and nat- ural language processing, this eliminates human error in verifying cyber security requirements for vehicle cyber security.
