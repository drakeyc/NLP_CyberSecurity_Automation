Defense Against Adversarial Attacks by Langevin Dynamics was created by Vignesh Srinivasan, with the idea of utilizing classifier strategies for defense against adversarial attacks. This provides the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm for Defense (now MALADE). This algorithm is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (now MCMC) sampling method that utilizes auto-encoders. It was proved in (Srinivasan et al., 2019) to be efficient and robust against attacks. This algorithm takes the gradient of the energy function, and uses K’s Nearest Neighbors to classify images. The experiments were performed on the Madry model. After performing tests, it was visualized that the MALADE algorithm was robust amongst non-stochastic attacks. With this in mind, the Madry model and MALADE was combined to “Madry + MALADE.” Ultimately, MALADE will be utilized to classify the attack on the vehicle.
